# Giphy-API-Website
Using the Giphy API, search for gifs of your favorite cartoons

## Description ##
Made using the search feature through the Giphy API: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/ 

This website uses AJAX to connect to the Giphy API. It also uses:

* jQuery 
* Bootstrap 4.3
* JavaScript 

## Basics ##

This simple page was a lot of fun to create. It only uses two functions:

* showCartoons() handles the AJAX call and promise. Also holds the jQuery that makes the gifs appear on the page, as well as the onclick that switches from a still image to the animated one

* renderButtons() renders the initial buttons on page load and generates new buttons based on the user input in the form

## Roadmap ##

It'd be great to eventually add a way to share neat gifs you find through social media! More API's ahead.

## Shout Outs ##
Cartoons are important escapism.
